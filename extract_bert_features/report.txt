modeling.py:367:11: WARNING: tf.contrib.layers.layer_norm requires manual check. (Manual edit required) `tf.contrib.layers.layer_norm` has been deprecated, and its implementation has been integrated with `tf.keras.layers.LayerNormalization` in TensorFlow 2.0. Note that, the default value of `epsilon` is changed to `1e-3` in the new API from `1e-12`, and this may introduce numerical differences. Please check the new API and use that instead.
modeling.py:367:11: ERROR: Using member tf.contrib.layers.layer_norm in deprecated module tf.contrib. tf.contrib.layers.layer_norm cannot be converted automatically. tf.contrib will not be distributed with TensorFlow 2.0, please consider an alternative in non-contrib TensorFlow, a community-maintained repository such as tensorflow/addons, or fork the required code.
modeling.py:413:22: WARNING: tf.get_variable requires manual check. tf.get_variable returns ResourceVariables by default in 2.0, which have well-defined semantics and are stricter about shapes. You can disable this behavior by passing use_resource=False, or by calling tf.compat.v1.disable_resource_variables().
modeling.py:423:17: WARNING: tf.nn.embedding_lookup requires manual check. `partition_strategy` has been removed from tf.nn.embedding_lookup.  The 'div' strategy will be used by default.
